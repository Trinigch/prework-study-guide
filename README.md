# Prework-Study-Guide-Webpage

## Description

The motivation behind this project was to prepare for my bootcamp studies by compiling a summary of notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. It serves as a guide to help avoid common mistakes and follow best practices when building a project. Through this process, Iâ€™ve enhanced my general knowledge, including learning how to create a professional README file, which is a critical component of project documentation.
